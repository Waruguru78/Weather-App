# Weather Application using react
The weather app allows users to input a specific date and location to get real-time weather updates for theentire day. The weather data is displayed in 3-hour intervals, giving users an accurate forecast for each part of the day. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the data and focused on creating a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface for a seamless experience.

Tech Stack:

1. React for the front-end

2. OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data

3. Axios for handling API calls

4. CSS and Bootstrap for a responsive and modern design
